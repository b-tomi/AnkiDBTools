# AnkiDBTools

A (barely organized) collection of scripts to manage the [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) database and automate various repetitive tasks, in order to make learning a foreign language more time efficient.

Created as I was getting into Python, before taking a proper course, meaning it might not always follow best practices or PEP8.

It's built around a specific deck and cards with a specific layout, so **it's unlikely to be useful other than as a reference**. 

### List of features
* copy content between cards with different layouts, such as example sentences
* generate content for certain fields from data in other cards *(e.g. from Kanji to vocab entries)*
* remove leftover formatting from copy-pasting from various sources *(mostly [weblio.jp](https://ejje.weblio.jp))*
* add custom formatting to specific fields in certain cards
* add specific tags to certain cards *(e.g. JLPT level to Kanji)*
* retrieve various information from external sources *(e.g. [jisho.org](https://jisho.org))* and add it to certain cards 
* retrieve words lists from external sources like [wiktionary.org](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists) and top request lists from [linguee.com](https://www.linguee.com/japanese-english)
* generate a list of most used characters from such word lists and insert their rank to certain cards
* two (fairly basic) GUI apps to look up and format entries to make adding new cards more time efficient
* a couple short scripts meant for one-time use, to automate certain tasks
* probably a few more things that I can't remember right now

As of now, I've been running main.py on a daily basis, to automate the boring stuff. *(Great book by [Al Sweigart](https://twitter.com/AlSweigart), by the way, not just for beginners.)*

Again, this was written for a specific deck and cards with a specific layout, so **it's unlikely to be useful other than as a reference**.
